I'm Nathan Lawrence, a web content professional currently working out of Columbia, Missouri, United States at [KBIA Public Radio](http://www.kbia.org) and [Classical 90.5](http://www.kmuc.org). I'm a recent graduate of Lawrence University (no relation), where I studied English, Film Studies and Gender/Ethnic Studies.

My mission is to create new ways for news organizations serving the public good to communicate with their users online.
