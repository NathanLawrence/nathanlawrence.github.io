### Audio Postcard
Take your Zoom H4N and collect sound and interviews to produce a 1:00 to 1:30 audio piece. You'll need **at least** one interview plus natural sound. The sound in the piece should help tell the story _with_ the words. Ambient and natural sound should run throughout at least half of the piece.

Some examples:

- ["Granny's House Serves Area Kids Through Mentorship Program"](http://kbia.org/post/grannys-house-serves-area-kids-through-mentorship-program?utm_campaign=class-link) (from KBIA)
